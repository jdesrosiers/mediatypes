1.  Introduction

   OpenAPI Specification [oas] version 3 and above is a consolidated
   standard for describing HTTP APIs using the JSON [JSON] and yaml
   [yaml] data format.

   To increase interoperability when processing API specifications and
   leverage content negotiation mechanisms when exchanging OpenAPI
   Specification resources this specification register the following
   media-types: application/yaml, application/openapi+json and
   application/openapi+yaml.

   Moreover it defines and registers the +yaml structured syntax suffix.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.  These words may also appear in this
   document in lower case as plain English words, absent their normative
   meanings.

   This document uses the Augmented BNF defined in [RFC5234] and updated
   by [RFC7405].

2.  Media Type registrations

   This section describes the information required to register the above
   media types according to [MEDIATYPE]

2.1.  Media Type application/yaml

   The following information serves as the registration form for the
   application/yaml media type.

   Type name: application

   Subtype name: yaml

   Required parameters: None

   Optional parameters: None; unrecognized parameters should be ignored

   Encoding considerations: Same as [JSON]

   Security considerations: see Section 3 of this document

   Interoperability considerations: None

   Published specification: (this document)

   Applications that use this media type: HTTP

   Fragment identifier considerations: Same as for application/json
   [JSON]

   Additional information:

   Deprecated alias names for this type: application/x-yaml, text/yaml,
   text/x-yaml

   Magic number(s): n/a

   File extension(s): yaml, yml

   Macintosh file type code(s): n/a

   Person and email address to contact for further information: See
   Authors' Addresses section.

   Intended usage: COMMON

   Restrictions on usage: None.

   Author: See Authors' Addresses section.

   Change controller: n/a

2.2.  The +yaml Structured Syntax Suffix

   The suffix +yaml MAY be used with any media type whose representation
   follows that established for application/yaml.  The media type
   structured syntax suffix registration form follows.  See [MEDIATYPE]
   for definitions of each of the registration form headings.

   Name: YAML Ain't Markup LanguageML (YAML)

   +suffix: +yaml

   References: [yaml]

   Encoding considerations: see Section 2.1

   Fragment identifier considerations:

Internet-Draft            REST API Media Types              January 2022


     The syntax and semantics of fragment identifiers specified for
     +yaml SHOULD be as specified for {{application-yaml}}

     The syntax and semantics for fragment identifiers for a specific
     `xxx/yyy+json` SHOULD be processed as follows:

     For cases defined in +yaml, where the fragment identifier resolves
     per the +yaml rules, then process as specified in +yaml.

        For cases defined in +yaml, where the fragment identifier does
        not resolve per the +yaml rules, then process as specified in
        `xxx/yyy+yaml`.

        For cases not defined in +yaml, then process as specified in
        `xxx/yyy+yaml`.

   Interoperability considerations: n/a

   Security considerations: See Section 2.1

   Contact: See Authors' Addresses section.

   Author: See Authors' Addresses section

   Change controller: n/a

2.3.  The OpenAPI Media Types

   The OpenAPI Specification Media Types convey OpenAPI document (OAS)
   files as defined in [oas] for version 3.0.0 and above.

   Those files can be serialized in [JSON] or [yaml].  Since there are
   multiple OpenAPI Specification versions, those media-types support
   the version parameter.

   The following examples conveys the desire of a client to receive an
   OpenAPI Specification resource preferably in the following order:

   1.  openapi 3.1 in yaml

   2.  openapi 3.0 in yaml

   3.  any openapi version in json

   Accept: application/openapi+yaml;version=3.1,
           application/openapi+yaml;version=3.0;q=0.5,
           application/openapi+json;q=0.3

3.  Security Considerations

   Security requirements for both media type and media type suffix
   registrations are discussed in Section 4.6 of [MEDIATYPE].

4.  IANA Considerations

   This specification defines the following new Internet media types
   [MEDIATYPE].

   IANA has updated the "Media Types" registry at
   https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types
   (https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types) with the registration
   information provided below.

Appendix A.  Acknowledgements

   Thanks to Erik Wilde and David Biesack for being the initial
   contributors of this specification, and to Darrel Miller and Rich
   Salz for their support during the adoption phase.

   In addition to the people above, this document owes a lot to the
   extensive discussion inside and outside the HTTPAPI workgroup,
   including Eemeli Aro and Ingy doet Net.

FAQ

   Q: Why this document?  After all these years, we still lack a proper
      media-type for yaml.  This has some security implications too (eg.
      wrt on identifying parsers or treat downloads)
