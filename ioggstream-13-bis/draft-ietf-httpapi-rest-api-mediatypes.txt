1.  Introduction

   OpenAPI Specification [oas] version 3 and above is a consolidated
   standard for describing HTTP APIs using the JSON [JSON] and yaml
   [yaml] data format.

   To increase interoperability when processing API specifications and
   leverage content negotiation mechanisms when exchanging OpenAPI
   Specification resources this specification register the following
   media-types: application/yaml, application/openapi+json and
   application/openapi+yaml.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.  These words may also appear in this
   document in lower case as plain English words, absent their normative
   meanings.

   This document uses the Augmented BNF defined in [RFC5234] and updated
   by [RFC7405].

2.  Media Type registrations

   This section describes the information required to register the above
   media types.

2.1.  Media Type application/yaml

   The following information serves as the registration form for the
   application/yaml media type.

   Type name: application

   Subtype name: yaml

   Required parameters: None

   Optional parameters: None; unrecognized parameters should be ignored

   Encoding considerations: Same as [JSON]

   Security considerations: see Section 3 of this document

   Interoperability considerations: None

   Published specification: (this document)

   Applications that use this media type: HTTP

   Fragment identifier considerations: Same as for application/json
   [JSON]

   Additional information:

   Deprecated alias names for this type: application/x-yaml, text/yaml,
   text/x-yaml

   Magic number(s): n/a

   File extension(s): yaml, yml

   Macintosh file type code(s): n/a

   Person and email address to contact for further information: See
   Authors' Addresses section.

   Intended usage: COMMON

   Restrictions on usage: None.

   Author: See Authors' Addresses section.

   Change controller: n/a

2.2.  The OpenAPI Media Types

   The OpenAPI Specification Media Types convey OpenAPI document (OAS)
   files as defined in [oas] for version 3.0.0 and above.

   Those files can be serialized in [JSON] or [yaml].  Since there are
   multiple OpenAPI Specification versions, those media-types support
   the version parameter.

   The following examples conveys the desire of a client to receive an
   OpenAPI Specification resource preferably in the following order:

   1.  openapi 3.1 in yaml

   2.  openapi 3.0 in yaml

   3.  any openapi version in json

   Accept: application/openapi+yaml;version=3.1,
           application/openapi+yaml;version=3.0;q=0.5,
           application/openapi+json;q=0.3

2.2.1.  Media Type application/openapi+json

   The following information serves as the registration form for the
   application/openapi+json media type.

   Type name: application

   Subtype name: openapi+json

   Required parameters: None

   Optional parameters: version; unrecognized parameters should be
   ignored

   Encoding considerations: Same as [JSON]

   Security considerations: see Section 3 of this document

   Interoperability considerations: None

   Published specification: (this document)

   Applications that use this media type: HTTP

   Fragment identifier considerations: Same as for application/json
   [JSON]

   Additional information:

   Deprecated alias names for this type: n/a

   Magic number(s): n/a

   File extension(s): json

   Macintosh file type code(s): n/a

   Person and email address to contact for further information: See
   Authors' Addresses section.

   Intended usage: COMMON

   Restrictions on usage: None.

   Author: See Authors' Addresses section.

   Change controller: n/a

2.2.2.  Media Type application/openapi+yaml

   The following information serves as the registration form for the
   application/openapi+yaml media type.

   Type name: application

   Subtype name: openapi+yaml

   Required parameters: None

   Optional parameters: version; unrecognized parameters should be
   ignored

   Encoding considerations: Same as [JSON]

   Security considerations: see Section 3 of this document

   Interoperability considerations: None

   Published specification: (this document)

   Applications that use this media type: HTTP

   Fragment identifier considerations: Same as for application/json
   [JSON]

   Additional information:

   Deprecated alias names for this type: n/a

   Magic number(s): n/a

   File extension(s): yaml, yml

   Macintosh file type code(s): n/a

   Person and email address to contact for further information: See
   Authors' Addresses section

   Intended usage: COMMON

   Restrictions on usage: None.

   Author: See Authors' Addresses section

   Change controller: n/a

3.  Security Considerations

   Security requirements for both media type and media type suffix
   registrations are discussed in Section 4.6 of [MEDIATYPE].

4.  IANA Considerations

   This specification defines the following new Internet media types
   [MEDIATYPE].

   IANA has updated the "Media Types" registry at
   https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types
   (https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types) with the registration
   information provided below.

Appendix A.  Acknowledgements

   Thanks to Erik Wilde and David Biesack for being the initial
   contributors of this specification, and to Darrel Miller and Rich
   Salz for their support during the adoption phase.

   In addition to the people above, this document owes a lot to the
   extensive discussion inside and outside the HTTPAPI workgroup,
   including Eemeli Aro and Ingy doet Net.

FAQ

   Q: Why this document?  After all these years, we still lack a proper
      media-type for yaml.  This has some security implications too (eg.
      wrt on identifying parsers or treat downloads)
